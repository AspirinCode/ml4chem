    Notes
    -----
    This loss function combines a distance measure between outputs and targets
    plus a sketch-map loss plus a regularization. See Eq. (5) from paper
    referenced above.

    When passing it to the Autoencoder() class, the model basically becomes an
    atom-centered model with the encodermap variant.

    There is something to note about regularization for this loss function.
    Autores of EncoderMap penalize both the weights using L2 regularization,
    and the magnitude of activations in the latent space layer.  is added in
    the optimizer The L2 regularization is included using weight_decay in the
    optimizer of choice. The activation penalization is computed below.
