**MLChem** is machine learning for chemistry.

This package is written in Python 3, and intends to offer modern and rich
features to perform machine learning workflows for chemical physics.

A list of features and methods are shown below.

- Atom-centered Neural Networks, and Kernel Ridge Regression for the prediction of total energies.
- PyTorch backend.
- GPU support.
- ASE interface.
- Completely modular. You can use any part of this package in your project.
- Free software <3. No secrets! Pull requests and additions are more than welcome!
- Good documentation (I hope!).
- Explicit and idiomatic: `mlchem.get_me_a_coffee()`.
- Scalability. Powered by Dask <3.
- [Messagepack serialization](https://msgpack.org/index.html).
